						<h2>here's another truth</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>And in fact while that all is 100% true, here's another truth: I fought to do work I believed in. I took risks, tried new things, and learned a lot. I recognized opportunities when they arrived, sometimes subtly disguised as hard work. I let people take chances on me and didn't turn them down out of fear. I discovered that seeing someone succeed because of something I did, no matter how minute, gave me great joy.</p>

							<p>I started my professional career at a company called Bazaarvoice, writing CSS to match our product to client sites. Our CSS was a disaster, written by Java devs over 5 years and never once cleaned up. I believed we could make it cleaner and more organized, but they wouldn’t let me do it in a dev release, because it had the potential to not be backwards compatible. So I did it anyway, just for my own team, and let people copy the new CSS for new projects. It cut our work time almost in half.</p>

I felt like I would never be inspired to work hard on anything again. Nothing was fun, my side projects had stagnated, I hated everything about my career. </p>

							<p>My tigers are thinking to myself, "if only you could do MORE, if only you worked all 8 hours a day instead of slacking off, if only you knew all the things you don't know, then you would be good at your job."</p>

							<p>But there will always be tigers.</p>

							<p>We must forget the tigers waiting to devour us and focus on what we are capable of doing now. We are drawn to challenges without knowing if we can face them. This leads to a fear of trying, a fear of being present, an inability to focus. So we become convinced we can't. Our focus is on the tigers, not the strawberries.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>This guy Steve Schwartz wrote a post called "No One Knows What the F*** They’re Doing (or “The 3 Types of Knowledge”)", and in it he talks about learning and impostor syndrome.</p>

							<p>"There’s the shit you know, the shit you know you don’t know, and the shit you don’t know you don’t know." (note: this chart is not to scale; the red slice is unimaginably huge.)</p>

							<p>"Traditional school would lead you to believe that you must cram as much information as possible into the `shit you know` category."</p>

							<p>"I am going to be bold and suggest that this is wrong. The goal isn’t to put as much as possible into the "shit you know" category, it’s to take as much as possible out of the "shit you don't know you don't know" category."</p>

							<p>[SCROLL DOWN]</p>

							<p>He gives an example: Imagine you are a nurse and you need to administer a drug to a patient. If you know that the prescribed drug reacts negatively with another drug the patient is taking, you know not to give it to them.</p>

							<p>If you remember that the drug has twenty side effects and tends to react with other drugs, you know to either look it up or ask someone else who knows. The only dangerous scenario could be NOT realizing that there could be any side-effects or reactions.</p>

							<p>The only dangerous category is the 'shit you don’t know you don’t know'. The same goes for any profession.</p>

							<p>In dev, or even design, we spend a lot of time just iterating, as we remove items from that category. We feel that we have no clue what we’re doing, yet we see others being confident.</p>

						<h6>Dreyfus model of skill acquisition</h6>
						<h3>Novice > Advanced Beginner > Competent > Proficient > Expert</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>In 1980, the Dreyfus brothers produced a now-famous model of skill acquisition. You begin as a Novice, and continue on to become an Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient and finally, an Expert.</p>

							<p>The gist of it is that you move from "dogmatic following of rules and lack of big picture" to "deliberate planning and perceiving deviations from the normal pattern" to  "intuitive transcending of rules and envisioning what is possible."</p>

							<p>When you start learning a new skill, you're completely incompetent. You begin by mostly being frustrated and unable to progress until someone spoon-feeds you the steps. Or else, as Dreyfus and Dreyfus put it, you "like a baby, pick it up by imitation and floundering".</p>

							<p>[breathe]</p>

							<p>Then you soon reach a point where the skill becomes possible to practice alone, and you are now excited and working hard. You improve rapidly as you do the easy, reachable parts. Once you complete those, however, the unsustainably rapid pace of improvement levels off, and learning more alone becomes difficult. </p>

							<p>[SCROLL DOWN]</p>

							<p>So some of us give up. We stop trying. We get set in our ways, never progressing or taking risks. Maybe we're too afraid to admit to colleagues we respect that there's something new we tried and failed at. Maybe we did, one time, admit it, and the response was...</p>

							<p>As a result, we tend to judge others solely by the end product, while we judge ourselves by the struggle we went through to get there.</p>

							<p>Many students I’ve met, for example, subconsciously believe in the idea of a universal programming expert; that, after working in the industry for some number of years, you become an endless repository of knowledge. They often think they’ve met many people like this.</p>

							<p>The problem? Any questions asked by a more junior programmer have already come up dozens of times for a more experienced programmer. This totally ignores the silent evidence: the many times each day that person struggles with more complex questions.</p>

							<p>When learning something new, we feel like we're drowning in information, barely able to keep our heads above water. But this is normal: your years of experience only give you the ability to search for more complex things, not to search less.</p>

							<p>I see this all the time in my classes at MakerSquare. Students want to be <em>told</em> how to build things, and that's not always something we can do. Tutorials and exercises always show the best possible scenario, and in real coding projects, you have so many more points of failure.</p>

							<p>We all feel this way, some days. This is a young industry. Five years ago, many of the mainstays of our jobs now didn't even exist. NOBODY is an expert, we all just have varying levels of experience and varying skills.</p>

							<p>On Wednesday, in my class, we were reviewing some homework on how to write float layouts. I had a student say, "I just feel like... I'm not doing it right. I feel like I'm hacking everything together."</p>

							<p>So I asked him what his workflow was. And as I expected, he said that he'd add the float, and a width, and it was wrong, so he'd go fix it, and then he'd have to clear something, and then remember that you can do clearfix instead.</p>

							<p>Sound familiar? I think beginners expect that at some point they'll just <em>know</em> how to do whatever they need to do without trial and error or searching</p>

								<p>Suddenly, there was a deadline, and work to be done. The night before my class, I practically had fever dreams about all the ways things could go wrong.</p>

							<p>A few months later, I gave my first ever Capital-T-Talk on Sass and refactoring at Refresh Austin.</p>

							<p>Emboldened, I submitted more talks. I got accepted. I panicked. Rinse and repeat and here I am.</p>

							<p><em>Side note: at this talk, 2 of my exes were in attendance, AND a guy who I was going on a first date with the next day. Absolutely terrifying.</em></p>

							<p>The hardest part of all of this is not standing up here and talking.</p>

                            <p>It's forcing myself to work, to sit down on beautiful sunny weekend days to write and edit and iterate, to DO. </p>

						<h4>&#8220;If only I could work like this everyday!&#8221;</h4>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Kate Matsudaira again: "My favorite days are the ones when I am a hurricane; when everything falls into place and I rip through tasks like a whirlwind. There is nothing that can stand in my way. Chances are you have had these days too, when you are in the flow, and making progress almost seems effortless.</p>

							<p>Hurricane days are my exception. And when those days are over, I'm amazed at my achievements and think: “If only I could do this everyday, how organized and successful would I be?”</p>

							<p>I think this ALL the time. I berate myself for the days I skip yoga, where I said I was going to clean all the things or work on some side project, and I didn't. I tell myself I am a lazy slob, that I'll never get that talk/promotion/etc, that I have such big dreams to see my work out in the world but the only way that it will get done is if I you know, DO IT, but I never will because I am a horrible lazy waste of air and everyone around me is infinitely better than me [SLIDE] and I might as well just go crawl in a hole or something.</p>

						<h2>be kind to yourself</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Kate writes, "Many years ago, it was suggested to me to imagine that I was directing such talk at a good friend, rather than at myself. I was horrified: I couldn’t imagine saying such awful things to someone I cared about."</p>

							<p>I try to be realistic. Did I skip the cleaning and side project work to lay on the couch and wallow in cookie crumbs and tears? Or did I skip it because I had a long week and truly needed some down time? One is valid. But the other, instead of berating myself, you know, the weekend is over. It does no good to make a Monday even harder than it has to be by starting it in a bad attitude. </p>

							<p>When we are gutsy enough to define our fears, they usually seem silly. Saying your horrible self-doubts aloud helps you realize how toxic it is to think that way. Just getting it out of your infinitely imaginative head helps. If you have a friend you trust, talk to them. Admit to the stuff that plagues you. They will probably have very obvious advice for you.</p>

								<p>Fifth, celebrate your wins.</p>

								<p>Defining your goals is important, but what about the "how will you know when you get there?" part?</p>

								<p>If you know what it means to succeed, it makes it hard to later discount your wins. If you wait until you hit your ultimate goal, have ultimate mastery and never screw anything up, you will never get to celebrate.</p>

								<p>I have a friend, Matt Jared, who taught himself to code and admits his beginner-ism, but is also now a successful front-end dev freelancer.</p>

                                <p>[SCROLL DOWN]</p>

								<p>He speaks to my students at MakerSquare occasionally, and tells them to celebrate their wins. He tells them that he watches the "I am the smartest man alive" clip from Billy Madison every time he does something awesome.</p>

								<p>In the book The Power of Habit, they talk about habit loops. A habit loop begins with a cue that triggers a habit.</p>

								<p>Matt says, "I hack that by forcing the cue when I figure something out. The celebration reinforces the feeling of success, and I know that feeling is coming when I'm in the middle of a struggle."</p>

							<p>You have a lot in the 'shit you don't know' category, so you can’t offer certainty without lying. You’re afraid that your colleagues won't accept you unless you know everything.

						<h2>Fake it til you make it?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>We sometimes conflate "fake it til you make it" with going on the defensive when our skills are questioned, or bluffing when asked to do something we are uncomfortable with. </p>

							<p>It's not that at all. It's just about accepting where you are in your journey, and being confident anyway.</p>

							<p>It's rare that not knowing the answer makes you look like an idiot. What makes you look like an idiot is blundering about making things up as you go along and word-vomiting because your ego is fragile. Nobody worth knowing was ever mean to someone who said, "I don't know, will you help me find out?"</p>

                            <p>[SCROLL DOWN]</p>

							<p>John Allspaw, the Senior VP of Infrastructure and Ops at Etsy, wrote a fantastic blog post about what it means to be a senior engineer. He writes, "Mature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them. At Etsy we call this a “generosity of spirit.” These engineers spend the time to make sure that more junior or new engineers unfamiliar with the tech or processes we have not only understand what they are doing, but also why they are doing it."</p>

							<p>And when you are the one doing the teaching, don’t play the expert; be honest with yourself—and them—about how long it took you to get there.</p>

						<h3>No feigning surprise</h3>
						<h3>No well-actually's</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Hacker School has a set of Social Rules, and they include the following:</p>

							<p><b>No feigning surprise</b> You shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't know something. This applies to both technical things ("What?! I can't believe you don't know what the stack is!") and non-technical things. This has absolutely no social or educational benefit: people usually do it to boost their own ego. And even when that's not the intention, it's almost always the effect. </p>

                            <p>[SCROLL DOWN]</p>

							<p><b>No well-actually's</b> A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost, but not entirely, correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation. This doesn't mean Hacker School isn't about truth-seeking or that we don't care about being precise: almost all well-actually's in our experience are about grandstanding, not truth-seeking. </p>

							<p>I wanted to start building ATXNerdyLadies, a site to organize all the local women in tech groups, an idea I'd been stewing on for months.</p>

							<p>Even though I worked on a Rails app every day, I never started on it because I felt I didn't know how to build an app, and let’s be real, I was just too intimidated to even try.</p>

							<p>So I recruited some super-smart ladies to help, and I asked Kassandra, a JavaScript dev, to start building the app while I started work on the layout and HTML. But she kept asking me questions about how I wanted it set up and it was awkward and I felt really stupid! Eventually I fessed up and said "I don’t know, I don’t know how this works, but I really wish I did, this is the reason I haven't done anything yet."</p>

                            <p>[SCROLL DOWN]</p>

							<p>And her face just lit up with excitement and she says, "Oh, it's so easy and awesome!" And then, most importantly: "Come here, I'll show you!"</p>

							<p>We sat down at her computer and I watched her go through setting up a Node app, and how to make routes. She made me do some, too, and it was actually really easy. Then she showed me how to set up Grunt and LiveReload and use it with Sass—another thing I was embarrassed to admit to not knowing because I had just been on a panel at SassConf—and it seemed like a thing I should have just known via osmosis, like I just magically was gonna pick up that knowledge along the way).</p>

							<p>Later at that same hackathon, a lady I know who is an amazing PM, was telling me she wanted to start a blog because she has been writing about project management and how to be good to your engineers, but she didn't know how, and maybe she’d just leave the hackathon because she didn’t want to waste anyone’s time and she didn’t know where to start...you know.</p>

							<p>I was feeling excited and inspired because someone had shared new knowledge with me, and I know how to set up a blog, so I sat down with her and got her set up on Octopress.</p>
