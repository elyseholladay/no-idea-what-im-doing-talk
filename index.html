                        <p>Hey everybody. I'm Elyse—I'm a Front End Architect from Austin, TX. I currently work at RetailMeNot building internal front end tools, and I used to teach coding to beginners.</p>
						<p>People ask me, “How did you get to be where you are now? You have a great job, you're speaking at conferences, helping start a podcast, you were teaching people to code...you must know so much and know all the right people and and and—” To set the record straight, here's how it went down.</p>
						<p>I was in the right place at the right time. I got lucky, because there are so many people better than me at this. I never know if I can do what my job entails so I just muddle through and hope for the best. I don’t really know what I am doing, I say yes to everything and then realize I’ll probably fail miserably. I write all my talks at the last minute and spend a lot of time panicking on Twitter.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">

						<p>And in fact while that all is 100% true, here's another truth: I fought to do work I believed in. I took risks, tried new things, and learned a lot. I recognized opportunities when they arrived, sometimes subtly disguised as hard work. I let people take chances on me and didn't turn them down out of fear. I learned that a compliment feels WAY better when you don't immediately put yourself down in response. I discovered that seeing someone succeed because of something I did, no matter how small, gave me great joy—and even more joy to not take credit, but to shine the light back on them, and their success.</p>

						<p>There is an Indian story that my yoga teacher told us one time in class about a woman being chased by tigers. She runs and runs and the tigers are getting closer and closer.

						<p>We must forget the tigers waiting to devour us and focus on what we are capable of doing now. We are drawn to challenges without knowing if we can face them.

						<p>I have come to think that yoga and coding have a LOT in common. My yoga instructor, Laura, that's her up there, she makes us regularly work on advanced poses that none of us can do. She says, "your perfect pose is different from the person's next to you"</p>

						<p>This guy Steve Schwartz wrote a post called "No One Knows What the F*** They’re Doing (or “The 3 Types of Knowledge”)", and in it he talks about learning and impostor syndrome.</p>

						<p>He says, "There’s the shit you know, the shit you know you don’t know, and the shit you don’t know you don’t know." (note: this chart is not to scale; the red slice is unimaginably huge.)</p>

						<p>"Traditional school would lead you to believe that you must cram as much information as possible into the `shit you know` category."</p>

						<p>"I am going to be bold and suggest that this is wrong. The goal isn’t to put as much as possible into the "shit you know" category, it’s to take as much as possible out of the "shit you don't know you don't know" category."</p>

						<p>He gives an example: Imagine you are a nurse and you need to administer a drug to a patient. If you know that the prescribed drug reacts negatively with another drug the patient is taking, you know not to give it to them.</p>

						<p>If you remember that the drug has twenty side effects and tends to react with other drugs, you know to either look it up or ask someone else who knows. The only dangerous scenario could be NOT realizing that there could be any side-effects or reactions.</p>

						<p>The only dangerous category is the 'shit you don’t know you don’t know'. The same goes for any profession.</p>

						<p>In dev, or even design, we spend a lot of time just iterating, as we remove items from that category. We feel that we have no clue what we’re doing, yet we see others being confident.</p>

						<p>First, they have figured this out, and thus they deserve it no more (and no less) than we do. They have a very large `shit you know you don’t know` category, and we can only imagine how immense the `shit you don’t know you don’t know` category is.</p>

						<p>or, 2) they legitimately think they know everything. Obviously, they do not. These people are usually very egotistical and don’t realize how little they really know. And probably spend a lot of time being pedantic and telling you how wrong you are.</p>

					<h6>Dreyfus model of skill acquisition</h6>
					<h3>Novice > Advanced Beginner > Competent > Proficient > Expert</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>In 1980, the Dreyfus brothers produced a now-famous model of skill acquisition. You begin as a Novice, and continue on to become an Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient and finally, an Expert.</p>

						<p>The gist of it is that you move from "dogmatic following of rules and lack of big picture" to "deliberate planning and perceiving deviations from the normal pattern" to  "intuitive transcending of rules and envisioning what is possible."</p>

							<p>First, be lucky.</p>

							<p>You know the kind of person about whom you say, "they have all the luck"? They probably work pretty hard at it. Luck depends not just on a lucky thing happening to you, but also identifying it and acting on it. This is entirely internal.</p>

							<p>If you’re looking for opportunities, you’ll see them when they come your way. If you're convinced that you can't do something, you'll turn down the offer. Stop lying to yourself about your skills. You don't always know what you can do. The sheer fact that someone asked you to do something or invited you to participate means they believed you would have something valuable to add.</p>

                            <p>Jina Bolton is one of my industry heroes. Her talks on refactoring inspired not just my work, but my first talk. Last spring we were at a conference in San Francisco. A bunch of the ladies who spoke and attended had brunch together, including Claudina who spoke earlier. After quite a few mimosas, it came up that I did similar work to her, and that conversation ended with Jina and I submitting a joint workshop on refactoring to SassConf. I definitely had a moment like, "wait, you want to do a talk WITH ME!? I'm nobody!"—but we had a great time, and both learned a lot. I would have never guessed I'd get to work with Jina.</p>

							<p>Third, work joyously.</p>

							<p>We all have heroes. Maybe yours is designer or developer at your company, or one who blogs, or speaks. Or maybe it's someone in a totally different industry. I'll bet, though, that you see their work and go, "wow, they are always putting out blog posts, or cool side projects. I wish I could be that productive!"</p>

                            <p>My boyfriend, Jeffrey, is totally the domestic, between us. He's constantly doing little tasks around the house. He'll fold a laundry basket of clean socks in between showering and eating breakfast. He makes his bed most mornings. At first, I didn't get it. I'd go, "why not just save it and do all the cleaning/laundry/whatever at once?" But his place is clutter-free and lovely to come home to, and I have a knee-deep pile of clean laundry on my floor.</p>

                            <p>It's not magic. You don't get inspired, sit down for an hour, and spit out a perfect conference talk. Your laundry doesn't do itself. Things get done in small, attainable, sometimes tedious tasks, over time. And you can do them with joy, instead of misery.</p>
							<p>When I decided I wanted to be more involved in the tech community, the first step I took was to TA a Girl Develop It class. A year went by, in which told anyone who would listen, that I wanted to write and teach a class myself. Then I got my chance. Suddenly, there was a deadline, and work to be done. The night before my class, I practically had fever dreams about all the ways things could go wrong.</p>

						<p>A few months later, I gave my first ever Capital-T-Talk on Sass and refactoring at Refresh Austin.</p>

						<p>Emboldened, I submitted more talks. I got accepted. I panicked. Rinse and repeat and here I am.</p>

						<p><em>Side note: at this talk, my boss and 2 of my exes were all in attendance, along with Jeffrey, who was taking me on our first date the next night. Absolutely terrifying.</em></p>

						<p>The hardest part of all of this is not standing up here and talking. Everyone assumes it is, because it's public speaking. "Isn't it scary? Are you nervous!? Doesn't traveling suck?" Really, the hard part is forcing myself to work, to sit down on beautiful sunny weekend days to write and edit and iterate, to DO. And then folding some socks when I'm stuck.</p>

						<p>Kate Matsudaira again: "My favorite days are the ones when I am a hurricane; when everything falls into place and I rip through tasks like a whirlwind. There is nothing that can stand in my way. Chances are you have had these days too, when you are in the flow, and making progress almost seems effortless. Hurricane days are my exception. And when those days are over, I'm amazed at my achievements and think: “If only I could do this everyday, how organized and successful would I be?”</p>

						<p>I think this ALL the time. I berate myself for the days I skip yoga, where I said I'd cook or clean or do side project work but didn't. I'm a lazy slob, I'll never get that talk, I have such big dreams to see my work out in the world but the only way that it will get done is if I you know, DO IT, but I never will because I am a horrible lazy waste of air and everyone around me is infinitely better than me [SLIDE] and I might as well just go crawl in a hole or something.</p>

						<p>Kate writes, "Many years ago, it was suggested to me to imagine that I was directing such talk at a good friend, rather than at myself. I was horrified: I couldn’t imagine saying such awful things to someone I cared about."</p>

						<p>I try to be realistic. Did I skip the cleaning and side project work to lay on the couch and wallow in cookie crumbs and tears? Or did I skip it because I had a long week and truly needed some down time? One is valid. But the other, instead of berating myself, you know, the weekend is over. It does no good to make a Monday even harder than it has to be by starting it in a bad attitude. </p>

                        <p>When we are gutsy enough to define our fears, they usually seem silly. Saying your horrible self-doubts aloud helps you realize how toxic it is to think that way. Just getting it out of your infinitely imaginative head helps. If you have a friend you trust, talk to them. Admit to the stuff that plagues you. They will probably have very obvious advice for you.</p>

                        <p>If you can identify your doubts, you can use that information to your benefit in the future. Do this not so you can avoid those situations that make you doubt, but to find ways to conquer the doubts individually, like an game of Existential Self-Doubt Whack-A-Mole. </p>

                            <p>He used to come speak to my students at MakerSquare, and he'd tell them to celebrate their wins. He tells them that he watches the "I am the smartest man alive" clip from Billy Madison every time he does something awesome.</p>

					<h3>Fake it til you make it?</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
                        <p>You have a lot in the 'shit you don't know' category, so you can’t offer certainty—especially not in this industry—without lying. You’re afraid that your colleagues won't accept you unless you know everything. It makes you feel insecure, because you WANT to be accepted by your colleagues and coworkers, but you feel you have to pretend or be dismissed as a dumb, helpless idiot.</p>

                        <p>We sometimes conflate "fake it til you make it" with going on the defensive when our skills are questioned, or bluffing when asked to do something we are uncomfortable with. </p>

						<p>It's not that at all. It's just about accepting where you are in your journey, and being confident anyway.</p>

						<p>It's rare that not knowing the answer makes you look like an idiot. What makes you look like an idiot is blundering about making things up as you go along and word-vomiting because your ego is fragile. Nobody worth knowing was ever mean to someone who said, "I don't know, will you help me find out?"</p>
